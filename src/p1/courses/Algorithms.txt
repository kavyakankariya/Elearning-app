Introduction:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms are the foundation of computer programming and are used to process data, perform calculations, and automate reasoning tasks. They are not tied to any specific programming language but can be implemented in any language. A good algorithm is efficient, correct, and easy to understand.

Characteristics of a Good Algorithm:
● Finiteness: Must terminate after a finite number of steps.
● Definiteness: Each step must be clearly defined.
● Input: Can have zero or more inputs.
● Output: Produces at least one output.

● Effectiveness: Steps are simple enough to be performed exactly and in reasonable
time.

Types of Algorithms:
1. Recursive Algorithms: Solve a problem by calling themselves with smaller inputs.
2. Divide and Conquer Algorithms: Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve
them, and combine results.
3. Greedy Algorithms: Make the best choice at each step to find a global optimum.
4. Dynamic Programming: Solve complex problems by breaking them into simpler
overlapping sub-problems and storing results.
5. Brute Force Algorithms: Try all possible solutions to find the correct one.

Common Operations in Algorithms:
● Searching: Finding an element in a data structure (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search).
● Sorting: Arranging elements in a particular order (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick
Sort).
● Insertion/Deletion: Adding or removing elements efficiently.
● Traversal: Visiting all elements in a data structure (e.g., Tree or Graph traversal).

Algorithm Analysis:
● Time Complexity: Measures how execution time grows with input size.
● Space Complexity: Measures memory usage during execution.
● Big O Notation: Expresses the upper bound of time or space complexity to compare
efficiency.

Applications of Algorithms:
● Search Engines: Ranking and retrieving relevant data efficiently.
● Social Networks: Friend suggestions and news feed algorithms.

● E-commerce: Product recommendations and sorting/searching products.
● Data Compression and Encryption: Efficiently encode and secure data.
