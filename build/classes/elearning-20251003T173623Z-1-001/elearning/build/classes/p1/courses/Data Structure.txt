Introduction:
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Choosing the right data structure is crucial for solving a problem effectively, as it directly impacts the performance of algorithms. Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data for tasks such as storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

Classification of Data Structures:
Data structures can be broadly classified into two types:

Primitive Data Structures:
These are the basic building blocks for other data structures. Examples include:

int, float, char, boolean

Variables used to store single values

Non-Primitive Data Structures:
These store collections of data and are more complex:

Linear Data Structures: Data elements are arranged sequentially. Examples:

Array: Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.

Linked List: Collection of nodes, where each node points to the next.

Stack: Follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle; insert and remove from the top.

Queue: Follows FIFO (First In First Out) principle; insert at rear, remove from front.

Non-Linear Data Structures: Data elements are not sequential; relationships can be hierarchical or networked. Examples:

Tree: Hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.

Graph: Collection of nodes connected by edges; can represent networks.

Operations on Data Structures:
Data structures allow various operations, depending on the type:

Insertion: Adding an element

Deletion: Removing an element

Traversal: Visiting each element systematically

Searching: Finding an element

Sorting: Arranging elements in order

Advantages of Data Structures:

Efficient data storage and retrieval

Reduced memory wastage

Simplifies complex problems

Helps in implementing algorithms effectively

Applications:

Databases use trees and hash tables for indexing.

Stacks are used in undo functionality and expression evaluation.

Queues are used in job scheduling and buffering.

Graphs are used in social networks, routing, and maps.
