Introduction:
Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet or an intranet. It involves building the structure, design, functionality, and user experience of web pages. Web development can range from creating simple static pages to
complex dynamic applications. Developers use a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools to make websites interactive, responsive, and user-friendly.
Types of Web Development:

1. Front-End Development (Client-Side):
○ Focuses on what users see and interact with on the browser.
○ Uses languages like HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript
(interactivity).
○ Front-end frameworks/libraries: React, Angular, Vue.js.
2. Back-End Development (Server-Side):
○ Handles server logic, databases, authentication, and application functionality.
○ Uses languages like Python, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby.
○ Works with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
3. Full-Stack Development:
○ Involves both front-end and back-end development.
○ Full-stack developers can build complete web applications independently.

Core Technologies:
● HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Defines the structure of web pages.
● CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles web pages, including layout, colors, and fonts.
● JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

Additional Tools and Concepts:
● Responsive Design: Websites adapt to different screen sizes using CSS and
frameworks like Bootstrap.
● Version Control: Tools like Git help track changes and collaborate on code.
● APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Allow communication between different
software components or services.
● Web Hosting and Domain: Websites are hosted on servers and accessed via domain
names.

Web Development Process:
1. Planning: Define the purpose, target audience, and functionality.
2. Designing: Create layouts, wireframes, and user interface design.
3. Development: Write front-end and back-end code to implement features.
4. Testing: Check functionality, responsiveness, and performance.
5. Deployment &amp; Maintenance: Launch the website and update it regularly.

Advantages of Web Development:
● Provides global access to information and services.
● Enhances business visibility and customer engagement.
● Supports e-commerce, social networking, and online communication.
● Enables automation of processes and data management.
